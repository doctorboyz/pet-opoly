# üêæ Pet-opoly Game

Welcome to Pet-opoly! This is a fun, browser-based board game inspired by Monopoly, but with a creative twist: instead of buying properties, you adopt adorable pets! This project is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a polished user experience without needing a server.
