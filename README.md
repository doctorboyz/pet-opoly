# 🐾 Pet-opoly Game

Welcome to Pet-opoly! This is a fun, browser-based board game inspired by Monopoly, but with a creative twist: instead of buying properties, you adopt adorable pets! This project is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on a polished user experience without needing a server.

## ✨ Features

* **Player Setup:** Supports 2 to 4 players with customizable names and unique token colors.
* **Interactive Game Board:** A fully rendered, clickable game board created with CSS Grid and smooth, animated player movement.
* **Core Game Mechanics:** Roll dice, move your token, purchase unowned "pet" properties, and pay "rent" when landing on pets owned by others.
* **Bankruptcy & Winning:** Players who run out of money go bankrupt! The last player standing wins the game.
* **Custom Modals:** All alerts and confirmations have been replaced with a clean, custom-styled modal for a consistent and professional user experience.
* **Polished UI/UX:**
    * **Money Transfer Animation:** A coin icon animates between player cards when rent is paid.
    * **Purchase Animation:** A property's border pulses when it's newly adopted.
    * **Game Over Celebration:** A full-screen modal with a fun confetti animation declares the winner.
* **Procedural Sound Effects:** Simple sounds for dice rolls, token movement, and other actions are generated directly in the browser with the Web Audio API.
